## Plan
There seems to be 5 levels for vietnamese
- Level 1: 27 Lessons, 22 Assigments
- Level 2: 50 Lessons, 34 Assigments - 
- Level 3: 25 Lessons, 21 Assigments
- Level 4: 25 Lessons, 21 Assigments
- Level 5: 25 Lessons, 38 Assigments

In oRder to complete the 5 Lessons in a month... You should aim to finish close to 5 Lessons per day... LOL
ðŸ¤£
Doing the calculations it would look like this: 5x30 = 150 Lessons for the end of the month.
