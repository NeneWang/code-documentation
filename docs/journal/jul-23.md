## 6 Thu


- There is also Kaggle which you can extract data science analysis from it. As for what to do now? You can practice on building more AI models similar to Kaggle. Or also improve at algorithms?

So here the idea

So lets see: What should the daily algorithm look like?

I think I should attempt to build it from having the algorithms on the end.

So how do you summarize the current project?

- Work on the algorithms
- And the React UI Components which should just be Framer Challanges.
- 

- [ ] Learn Framer

The objective is creating a slight animation for each algorithm at certain level, and have it on Framer with an explainaition of the algorithm solution? Or at least have them moving.





Ideally You would start from the stack of work that is the closest to your work. you can create a react or framer to get started, And the same shoudlbe

So lets see waht are the easy 

Here the objectives I had set:

What is being expected of me?

- Being good at at least 1 front-end stack ( That could be React + Framer)
- Strong algorithmic thinking



What I want fo myself?
- Data Science on tip of my hand, perphaps being able to interpret 
- Large amount of personal 

You want to be good at aws spin offs, at understanding the projects, and having experience working on them. even if they were at personal work.

## 7 Fri

Routine: 

- [ ] Fix the todo list so that it marks whenever a task is marked
- [ ] Finish an algo
- [ ] Finish the todo list challange for Storybook.


- [ ] Build React Card Component
  - [ ] On hover plays animation


Things to document on:

- How to declare methods and hte like.
-
