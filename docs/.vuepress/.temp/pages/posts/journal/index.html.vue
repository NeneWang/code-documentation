<p>Hi, this is the proof that I have existed, and survived through the Corporate Zombie Apocalypse. I will write down my thoughts, my failures and my successes here as a corporate developer. I hope this can be a journal that I can pass down to my children and my children's children. This section is more of raw journal of the development and personal projects that I have done, without the compilation of tips.</p>

<p>The reason being here is the intent to create code even if it is not possible under &quot;certain&quot; circunstances
Example: Courses that actually are not related to code in Udemy, Zenga and others</p>

<p>More or less this can even serve as a catch-all for including all the work that it's neither a project or a anything else</p>

<p>Simple forecast predictions.</p>
<p>With those numbers we can predict. That as long as there is a reasonable strategy, twe can reach to a client base and predict some small revenue of a 1 person army.</p>
<p>Marketing Strategic Bases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building relationships in CS Community</li>
<li>Building relationships in Business Majors Community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Predict hiring. an expanding into different majors might require one major typand also research for that major type. and aplications types.</p>
