<p>I followed Software engineering path. Which I wouldn trecommend unless you have a passion for it, A passion for staying late-nights doing things that might not even correlate, like studying algorithms, researching into computers, working on projects and practicing your math.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have made into the career of software Development
<ul>
<li>I cant recommend it. No junior entries wanted only seniors with 5+ years of experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are new to this I would suggest a place like nurse or policeman or accounting.</li>
<li>Or other blue collar jobs that are not able to neither be automized nor outsourced.</li>
<li>Outsourceablle/automated jobs:
<ul>
<li>Software Development</li>
<li>Most other works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or social work like:
<ul>
<li>Maybe even teaching could be a good idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid careers that are not required to be in-person (e.g. can be outsourced )</li>
<li>Avoid careers that are mind-numbingly boring (e.g. can be automated)</li>
<li>Choose careers where a job in the position requires an local acreditation e.g. Accounting Accreditation, passing the engineering exam, law bar, etc.</li>
<li>If you are lucky to feel passion about something (willing to work for free 16 hours a day) then choose it regardless of the bullets above.
<ul>
<li>Please test yoursefl within those guidelines, e.g. test the career for a month of 16 hours a day, if you are still willing to do it then go for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid 'studies' or too 'general' careers:</li>
</ul>
