# Plan




## Future Features

### Automation
Yes, using this py thing perphaps I can automate how to write some code in the side?

These are my thoughts:

What are the avaialble if any advantages of using this instead of notion?

Couldn't I sync the stuff directly from Notion? e.g Download notion content automativally as Markdown.

I could use [this](https://github.com/echo724/notion2md):

## Expanding.
So, after analizing the advantages and disavantages, it comes out the question what to document here, and what is more convenient to directly document in for example Notion?

Here the following list to analize:
- Software Projects
  - Games
  - Web Apps
  - Mobile App
- Academia Projects
- Professional stuff

### Thoughts about the matter
As we had seen, while you "can" create a table of code (compared to notion) and even stylize it, the problems are:
- Slow Image Uploading
- Slow Documentation


Things that are better:
- Faster web load
- cohesion of pages in the web (table of contents, etc)
- Custom code
- Great impression for startups and academia (probably) (At least for me it was a great impression)


### Or does this come from a different worflow?

I wouldn't recommend starting with just VueJS, but straight with Notion feels better. Perphaps including a python script to download and organize the documents for me would make it easier to streamline the workflow. 

e.g of the work flow:
1. Write the documentation
2. Run Python Script
   1. Downlaods the Notion Documentation Into Readme
   2. Organizes the files: moves the (Images and assets)
3. Human Revision
4. Deploy using Make or Git
