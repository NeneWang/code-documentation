# Introduction

These are my thoughts:

What are the avaialble if any advantages of using this instead of notion?

Couldn't I sync the stuff directly from Notion? e.g Download notion content automativally as Markdown.

I could use [this](https://github.com/echo724/notion2md):


### Avantages Disavantages

Advantages:
- Professional looking when sharing documentation
- (Easy) Custom Code
- Doens't require a heavy machine to run, like notion
- Basic tables are back 
- Custom Link (Not notion marked)
- You get to learn Vue while documentating stuff
- Faster Load from any PC. (Probably a good idea for )
- Good for documentating Official Code ( Looks good )
- Table on the side!

Disavantages
- No more Easy Databases for me... 
- Bad for documentating Collections such as Udemy and Games.
- Editing must be done from dev Computer
