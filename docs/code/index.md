## Avantages Disavantages



Advantages:
- Professional looking when sharing documentation
- Custom Widgets and Styling
- Doens't require a heavy machine to run, like notion (Doens't consume that much memory...)
- Basic tables are back 
- You get to learn Vue while documentating stuff
- Faster Load from any PC. (Probably a good idea for the smaller lower power pcs)
- Table on the side!
- I look like a hacker üë©‚Äçüíª
- Free forever

Disavantages
- No more Easy Databases for me... 
- Bad for documentating Collections such as Udemy and Games.
- Editing must be done from dev Computer
- Slow deployment (Even if I had some code with me...) 
- Requires some setup to view the code (Althought you can even edit it with just git and some code editor)
