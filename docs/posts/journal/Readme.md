# Introduction

Hi, this is the proof that I have existed, and survived through the Corporate Zombie Apocalypse. I will write down my thoughts, my failures and my successes here as a corporate developer. I hope this can be a journal that I can pass down to my children and my children's children. This section is more of raw journal of the development and personal projects that I have done, without the compilation of tips. 


## This is the Journal

The reason being here is the intent to create code even if it is not possible under "certain" circunstances
Example: Courses that actually are not related to code in Udemy, Zenga and others

## Discussion Board

### What can be included here?

More or less this can even serve as a catch-all for including all the work that it's neither a project or a anything else
