   4. Your younger days will never come back. So take photos, keep them in memory
   5. Encourage usage of videos to record. Save them online for memory as well.
2. Enjoy and perform *Weekly Dates*.


**Projects**

For [1] Create some kind of memory folder with all these beautiful moments as a *support system*.
Try to also create your own blog with your partner when it comes to this projects.

For [2] Develop a wheel with all the weekly images that are being sent.

It would be interesting to develop some kind of software that takes in a snapchat-like request to be sent photos, and memories.
You could prototype that concept using `Be Real`
