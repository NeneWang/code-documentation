## Flutter Meals

This version I am having different cards, whereas you can highlight them. What I want to have it is as a cards sharing tool. Whereas I can send her multiple cards of things she can do.

And then on a button click I just tell her dont to randomly click it, or the purpose is lost. I just trust her on having the cards there unlocking other cards.
