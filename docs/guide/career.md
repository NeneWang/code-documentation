## Introduction


### Career Choices

- I have made into the career of software Development
  - I cant recommend it. No junior entries wanted only seniors with 5+ years of experience
- If you are new to this I would suggest a place like nurse or policeman.
- Or other blue collar jobs that are not able to neither be automized nor outsourced.
- Outsourceablle/automated jobs: 
  - Software Development
  - Accounting
- Or social work like:
  - Maybe even teaching could be a good idea.
