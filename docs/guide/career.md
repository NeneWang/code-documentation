## Introduction


## 1. Career Choices

I followed Software engineering path. Which I wouldn trecommend unless you have a passion for it, A passion for staying late-nights doing things that might not even correlate, like studying algorithms, researching into computers, working on projects and practicing your math.

- I have made into the career of software Development
  - I cant recommend it. No junior entries wanted only seniors with 5+ years of experience
- If you are new to this I would suggest a place like nurse or policeman or accounting.
- Or other blue collar jobs that are not able to neither be automized nor outsourced.
- Outsourceablle/automated jobs: 
  - Software Development
  - Most other works.
- Or social work like:
  - Maybe even teaching could be a good idea.

As a general rule:
- Avoid careers that are not required to be in-person (e.g. can be outsourced )
- Avoid careers that are mind-numbingly boring (e.g. can be automated)
- Choose careers where a job in the position requires an local acreditation e.g. Accounting Accreditation, passing the engineering exam, law bar, etc.
- If you are lucky to feel passion about something (willing to work for free 16 hours a day) then choose it regardless of the bullets above.
  - Please test yoursefl within those guidelines, e.g. test the career for a month of 16 hours a day, if you are still willing to do it then go for it.
- Avoid 'studies' or too 'general' careers: 

## 2. College Tips

- Avoid non-science (or non hard) classes
- Always do projects and struggle with the homework.
- Create a portfolio of your projects
- Create a memoization of the practice sets, to be done on the daily


## 3. Progressing your Portfolio

1. Make software Projects that can be shown to recru
   1. Keep in readme the sets of Install options and descriptions with pictures and captures of it's features.
   2. Create a `highlight.md` file tracking the progression of your software and HIGHLIGHT whenever you face an interesting challange.
2. Try to avoid repeating your stack.

## 4. Make Reusable Templates


1. Once you have a project done, dont let it stay like that, build a library/template out of it.
2. The entire project doesn't require to become a library, but aim to create a library from one of the complex parts of the project.
