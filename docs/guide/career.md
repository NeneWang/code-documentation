## Introduction


## 1. Career Choices

I followed Software engineering path. Which I wouldn trecommend unless you have a passion for it, A passion for staying late-nights doing things that might not even correlate, like studying algorithms, researching into computers, working on projects and practicing your math.

- I have made into the career of software Development
  - I cant recommend it. No junior entries wanted only seniors with 5+ years of experience
- If you are new to this I would suggest a place like nurse or policeman or accounting.
- Or other blue collar jobs that are not able to neither be automized nor outsourced.
- Outsourceablle/automated jobs: 
  - Software Development
  - Most other works.
- Or social work like:
  - Maybe even teaching could be a good idea.

As a general rule:
- Avoid careers that are not required to be in-person (e.g. can be outsourced )
- Avoid careers that are mind-numbingly boring (e.g. can be automated)
- Choose careers where a job in the position requires an local acreditation e.g. Accounting Accreditation, passing the engineering exam, law bar, etc.
- If you are lucky to feel passion about something (willing to work for free 16 hours a day) then choose it regardless of the bullets above.
  - Please test yoursefl within those guidelines, e.g. test the career for a month of 16 hours a day, if you are still willing to do it then go for it.
- Avoid 'studies' or too 'general' careers: 

## 2. College Tips

- 1. Avoid non-science (or non hard) classes
- 2. Always do projects and struggle with the homework.
- 3. Create a portfolio of your projects
- 4. Create a memoization of the practice sets, to be done on the daily
- 5. Join Clubs and Be friendly, offer your services, always talk well, present good news.
- 6. Build a strong early-career, snowball and leverage such to meet people and make the *pact*. Whereas you promise each ther of *recommending each other*. Attempt to target promising 3 students every week. Funnel-down and get those recommendations.

**Projects**

For [6] I would suggest the following strategies:

- Definitively collect the user tags
- Organize conversation topics bubble project.
- Organize the target market, rate and score the leads. (race, school, advancing potential)

- You should aim, to do the same, even digitally. Just talk, and ask the::
- - What technologies are you more familiar, etc.
- And like, do you want to play some mini-games, do you have steam? Wanna try pubg?


## 3. Progressing your Portfolio

1. Make software Projects that can be shown to recru
   1. Keep in readme the sets of Install options and descriptions with pictures and captures of it's features.
   2. Create a `highlight.md` file tracking the progression of your software and HIGHLIGHT whenever you face an interesting challange.
2. Try to avoid repeating your stack.

## 4. Make Reusable Templates


1. Once you have a project done, dont let it stay like that, build a library/template out of it.
2. The entire project doesn't require to become a library, but aim to create a library from one of the complex parts of the project.


## 5. Model Successfull People on Your career

1. Not the louds ones, that got there by luck. Try to find those who worked hard. I know it might be cringy but model their approach as best as you can. Also if they are from a similar background, the better.
2. What certifications did they study? What projects they have built? What Habits did they accomplish?
