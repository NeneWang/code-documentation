## 1 Practicing Algorithms Daily

- Is likely that you wont be using algorithms on your job (or at least not in the hard complexity ones.)
  - But on your journey to learning algorithms, You will learn the skill of problem solving throguht pattern recognition.
  - This is a significantly useful skill, as in software following patterns for solutions leads to optimized, mantainable, efficient strategies based where you can share and have at the same time an efficient solution.
- If you havent started, go throguht the 150 recommended lists.
  - Give yourself 20-30 minutes to struggle with the problem
  - Watch a video/editorial solution for it. (even if you were able to solve it) 
  - Dont prioritize learning the most optimal solution, but the solution that uses the `pattern` you are aiming to understand. Tackle the pattern > Tackle the most efficient way to solve it. 
  - Try replicating the solution from memory
  - Do 1 similar problem. (easier is okay) The idea is for you to **understand** that pattern.
- Once you complete 150


## 2 Practice DataScience + Machine Learning Daily

- I dont care if this is wasn't your original goal. If you dont do it, you will eventually be replaced by someone who does.
- Also a strong skill to have for your own projects and if you will start a business.


### Projects

- [Ideation]: Presentation Trainer Tool. 



## 3 How to successfully learn a Framework/Language

    When do you consider yourself good at a language?
  - Because you can create a project with that? No
  - Because you have a job with that? No
  - Because you can solve problems with that? No
  - But because you can really understand whats the reason that language/framework and whats the cycle and context that langauge/framework/environment supports and the best practices on it.

- When you are using a language framework, always try to learn it's best practices
- Otherwise you are not really learning the `pattern` of the language.
- This usually involves:

2. Best Practices goals

- File Structure
  - Usually because of a reason, where do you organize components/ Whats the hierarchy of files? What files to ignore, where to write your environment variables, etc.
- Naming Conventions
  - Key, do it use camelCase? PascalCase? snake_case? kebab-case? What are the best practices for naming variables, functions, classes, etc.
- Code Style
  - How are classes organized? How are functions organized? How are variables organized? How are comments organized?
- Testing
  - Whats the CD CI Pipeline strategy for this framework? Is this more of an UI testing? Unit testing? No testing? Whats the best practice when it comes to organizing
- Documentation Strategy 
    - Deployment Strategy. Many languages allow for in-code documentation, to auto-produce documentation files. Take advantage of that. Try to use that support on each language/framework.
    - Different Languages have different documentation strategies that are optimized for that tool's objective, be it building visual components, enhancing test documentation, etc.
- Development Cycles Practices for that language/framework
  - Whats the initial mock and requirement listing 
- Common Design Patterns on that language.
  - Whats the pattern used for that language in specific? Why that design pattern helps?


## 4 Going through Trainning as an Engineer Mentality


1. College courses, bootcamp, online course follow the following pattern
2. Develop Flashcards based on the best practices listed above so you dont forget them.
3. Create tasks cards for future practice so that you can train yourself into using those cases.
   1. For example you are learning react, you should create a card and git repo for a project start and how the project should look at the project finish.



### Project

- Presentation Task Oriented Tool for [3]:
  - This tool should allow for users to create their own tasks.
  - Time limit them so that a task 
  - When creating a task
    - Suggested time limitation for the task

- Mastery CLI for [2]
  - Should be able to share their deck of cards.
  - Should be allowed for free




## 5 Building a reputation for Consistency

- You should be able to show that you are consistent in your work and software that contains heatmaps or streak recordings are usually one of the bests.
- Use github, publish almost daily, participate on projects, create followers, follow me, I will follow you automatically.
- Use Leetcode, publish daily, dont be like me that didnt use that much, because of fear of not being able to use them. 
- Message your boss at least once, and each member of the team, invent an excuse, any works
  - Design thoughts.
  - A new library you found that might be applicable.
