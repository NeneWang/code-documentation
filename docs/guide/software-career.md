## Practicing Algorithms Daily

- Is likely that you wont be using algorithms on your job (or at least not in the hard complexity ones.)
  - But on your journey to learning algorithms, You will learn the skill of problem solving throguht pattern recognition.
  - This is a significantly useful skill, as in software following patterns for solutions leads to optimized, mantainable, efficient strategies based where you can share and have at the same time an efficient solution.
- If you havent started, go throguht the 150 recommended lists.
  - Give yourself 20-30 minutes to struggle with the problem
  - Watch a video/editorial solution for it. (even if you were able to solve it) 
  - Dont prioritize learning the most optimal solution, but the solution that uses the `pattern` you are aiming to understand. Tackle the pattern > Tackle the most efficient way to solve it. 
  - Try replicating the solution from memory
  - Do 1 similar problem. (easier is okay) The idea is for you to **understand** that pattern.
- Once you complete 150


## Practice DataScience + Machine Learning Daily

- I dont care if this is wasn't your original goal. If you dont do it, you will eventually be replaced by someone who does.
- Also a strong skill to have for your own projects and if you will start a business.

## How to successfully learn a Framework/Language

- When do you consider yourself good at a language?
  - Because you can create a project with that? No
  - Because you have a job with that? No
  - Because you can solve problems with that? No
  - But because you can really understand whats the reason that language/framework and whats the cycle and context that langauge/framework/environment supports and the best practices on it.

- When you are using a language framework, always try to learn it's best practices
- Otherwise you are not really learning the `pattern` of the language.
- This usually involves:

- File Structure
  - Usually because of a reason, where do you organize components/ Whats the hierarchy of files? What files to ignore, where to write your environment variables, etc.
- Naming Conventions
  - Key, do it use camelCase? PascalCase? snake_case? kebab-case? What are the best practices for naming variables, functions, classes, etc.
- Code Style
  - How are classes organized? How are functions organized? How are variables organized? How are comments organized?
- Testing
  - Whats the CD CI Pipeline strategy for this framework? Is this more of an UI testing? Unit testing? No testing? Whats the best practice when it comes to organizing
- Documentation Strategy 
    - Deployment Strategy. Many languages allow for in-code documentation, to auto-produce documentation files. Take advantage of that. Try to use that support on each language/framework.
    - Different Languages have different documentation strategies that are optimized for that tool's objective, be it building visual components, enhancing test documentation, etc.
- Development Cycles Practices for that language/framework
  - Whats the initial mock and requirement listing 
- Common Design Patterns on that language.
  - Whats the pattern used for that language in specific? Why that design pattern helps?
